      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification refines the semantics and interaction patterns of [[LDP]] in order to better serve the
        specific needs of those interested in implementing repositories for durable access to digital data.
        Additionally, this specification contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a reconciliation of [[LDP]] and the version identification and navigation scheme delineated
          in the Memento specification [[RFC7089]],
        </li>
        <li>
          integration with the Web Access Control proposal [[SOLIDWEBAC]],
        </li>
        <li>
          a design for the publication of asynchronous events emitted from an implementation,
        </li>
        <li>
          and interaction patterns for use with binary fixity information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal of this specification is to define the behaviors of Fedora server implementations in order to
        facilitate interoperability with client applications. Although Fedora servers are not necessarily drop-in
        replacements for one another, a client developed against this specification should work against any Fedora
        server with little modification. Client applications should not expect the behaviors of every Fedora server
        implementation to be identical, but the interaction patterns defined in this specification should provide a
        sufficient mechanism to navigate the differences between Fedora server implementations.

            to indicate versioning, a version container
            (<a>LDPCv</a>) MUST be created that contains Memento-identified resources (<a>LDPRm</a>) capturing
            time-varying representations of the associated <a>LDPR</a>. An <a>LDPCv</a> is both a <a>TimeMap</a> per

            specification for such resources in [[!RFC7089]]. An implementation MUST indicate <a>TimeMap</a> in the
            same way it indicates the Container interaction model of the resource via HTTP headers. An <a>LDPCv</a>

          Non-normative note:
          This section describes the way the normative specification might be applied to implement discoverable
          versioning patterns. If an implementation of an <a>LDPCv</a> does not support <code>POST</code> to mint
          versions, that must be advertised via <code>OPTIONS</code> as described above. This allows a client to
          perform an <code>OPTIONS</code> request on a <a>LDPCv</a> to determine if it can explicitly mint versions.
          If the <a>LDPCv</a> does not support <code>POST</code>, the client should assume some other mechanism is used
          to mint versions, for example, the implementation may automatically mint versions instead, but that is
          outside the requirements of this specification. This document specifies normatively only how <a>LDPCv</a>s

        <blockquote class="informative">
          <p>
            Non-normative note:
            This section defines when notifications are made available by a Fedora implementation, the minimal set of
            data contained in these notifications, and how the data are serialized. Notifications may be emitted
            synchronously or asynchronously with the API operations that cause them to be emitted. These notifications
            are typically used to support external integrations. The structure of these notifications draws upon the
            existing [[activitystreams-core]] and [[ldn]] specifications. An implementation is free to choose from any
            transport technology so long as the notifications conform to what is described in the following sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementers should be aware that some operations cause multiple resources to change. In these cases, there
            will be a corresponding notification describing each of the changes. This is especially true for changes to
            containment or membership triples. This is also true if a <code>DELETE</code> operation triggers changes in
            any contained resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consumers of these notifications should not expect a strict ordering of the events reported therein: the
            fact that a notification for Event A is received before a notification for Event B should not imply that
            Event A occurred before Event B. Implementations may choose to make further guarantees about ordering.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the [[activitystreams-core]] specification, it is possible to collect multiple events into a
            single notification. This specification makes no restriction on the use of activity stream collections.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        There are security considerations for any HTTP server exposed to the Internet. Implementations SHOULD make use
        of the many security-related features of HTTP, including use of the authentication framework defined in the
        Authentication chapter of the HTTP/1.1 specification [[!RFC7235]].
